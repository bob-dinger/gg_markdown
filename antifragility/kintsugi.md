The concept you're referring to is Kintsugi (金継ぎ), also known as Kintsukuroi (金繕い), which translates to "golden joinery" or "golden repair." This traditional Japanese art form involves repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. The philosophy behind Kintsugi embraces imperfections and values visible repairs, symbolizing a form of beauty that acknowledges an object's history and resilience.
