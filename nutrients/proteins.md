# Proteins

proteins are nothing more than long chains of amino acids. 

Insulin (made in our body), as an example, is a chain of 51 amino acids. 

There are 20 amino acids that humans use (there are about 100 in nature). 

We need 9 of them to come from our diet (essential amino acids)

Here are the 20.
