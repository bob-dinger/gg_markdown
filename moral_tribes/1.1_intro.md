# Moral Foundations Theory

Why do our values differ?

From Joshua Greene's [Moral Tribes](https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Tribes-Emotion-Reason-Between/dp/0143126059)

Greene describes 4 different environments, where groups of people make collective decisions in different ways.

This "in group" morality is shared to settle disputes between members of the same tribe.

Because everyone in the same group knows the same rules, and have similar emotional reactions to those rules being broken.

But we live in a modern world, where we have people from hundreds of different tribes interacting in the same space.
