# Westerners

<blockquote>
 To the west of the forest is another tribe whose herders also share a common pasture. There, however, the size of a family's flock is determined by the family's size. Here, too, there is a council of elders, which has made difficult decisions. One particularly fertile family had twelve children, far more than the rest. Some complained that they were taking up too much of the commons. A different family fell ill, losing five of their six children in one year. Some thought it unfair to compound their tragedy by reducing their wealth by more than half. Despite these challenges, the Western tribe has survived, as its families have prospered, some more than others.
