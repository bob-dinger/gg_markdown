# Explanation

The intuitive answers are 10 cents, 100 minutes and 24 days. 

The actual answers are 5 cents, 5 minutes and 47 days.

To get them right, you have to engage the rider, which is difficult, because the intuitive answers 'feel' right. 

This shows how difficult it is to engage the rider when the elephant is in charge.
