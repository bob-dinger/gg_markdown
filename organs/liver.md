# Liver

The liver is the largest organ in the body, weighing 3.3 pounds. 

At any given time, it has .. the body's blood supply. 



 The liver is a gland and it is, compared with the rest of our glands, gigantic. When fully grown, it weighs about 3.3 pounds, roughly the same as the brain, and fills much of the central abdomen just below the diaphragm. It is disproportionately large in infants, which is why their bellies are so delightfully rounded. It is also the most multifariously busy organ in the body, with functions so vital that if it shuts down, you will be dead within hours. Among its many jobs, it manufactures hormones, proteins, and the digestive juice known as bile. It filters toxins, disposes of obsolescent red blood cells, stores and absorbs vitamins, converts fats and proteins to carbohydrates, and manages glucose—a process which is so vital for the body that its dilution for even a few minutes can cause organ failure and even brain damage. (Specifically the liver converts glucose into glycogen—a more compact chemical. It is a little bit like shrink-wrapping food so you can pack more of it into your freezer. When energy is needed, the liver converts the glycogen back into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream.) Altogether the liver takes part in some five hundred metabolic processes. It is essentially the body’s laboratory. Right now, about a quarter of all your blood is in your liver.

Perhaps the most wondrous feature of the liver is its capacity to regenerate. You can remove two-thirds of a liver and it will grow back to its original size in just a few weeks.
