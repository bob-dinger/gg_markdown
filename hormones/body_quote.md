From Bill Bryson's [The Body]()

> Hormones are the bicycle couriers of the body, delivering chemical messages all around the teeming metropolis that is you. They are defined as any substance that is produced in one part of the body and causes an action somewhere else, but beyond that they are not easy to characterize. They come in different sizes, have different chemistries, go to different places, have different effects when they get there. Some are proteins, some are steroids, some are from a group called amines. They are linked by their purpose, not their chemistry. Our understanding of them is far from complete, and much of what we do know is surprisingly recent.

As late as 1958, only about twenty hormones were known. No one seems to know quite how many there are now. “Oh, I think it must be at least eighty,” says Wass, “but perhaps as many as a hundred now. We really do keep discovering more all the time.”

The pituitary is often called the master gland because it controls so much. It produces (or regulates the production of) growth hormone, cortisol, estrogen and testosterone, oxytocin, adrenaline, and much else. When you exercise vigorously, the pituitary squirts endorphins into your bloodstream. Endorphins are the same chemicals released when you eat or have sex. They are closely related to opiates. That’s why it is called the runner’s high. There is barely a corner of your life that the pituitary doesn’t touch, yet its functions weren’t even broadly understood until well into the twentieth century.

Addison’s in fact arises from an imbalance of cortisol levels—cortisol being a stress hormone that regulates blood pressure.

In 1995, the field of endocrinology experienced a seismic moment when Jeffrey Friedman, a geneticist at Rockefeller University in New York, found a hormone that no one thought could possibly exist. He named it leptin (from a Greek word for “thin”). Leptin was produced not in an endocrine gland but in fat cells. This was a most arresting discovery. No one had ever suspected that hormones could be produced anywhere but in their own dedicated glands. In fact, we now know, hormones are produced all over the place—in the stomach, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, brain, bones, everywhere.

Four years after leptin’s discovery, scientists discovered another hormone involved in appetite regulation. Dubbed ghrelin (the first three letters stand for “growth-hormone related”), it is produced mostly in the stomach but also in several other organs. When we get hungry, our ghrelin levels rise, but it isn’t clear whether ghrelin causes hunger or merely accompanies it.

The range of regulatory jobs any hormone does can be bewilderingly diverse. Oxytocin, to take one example, is well known for its role in generating feelings of attachment and affection—it is sometimes called “the hug hormone”—but it also plays an important part in facial recognition, in directing contractions of the uterus in childbirth, in interpreting the moods of people around us, and in initiating the production of milk by nursing mothers.
